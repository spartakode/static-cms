# Static CMS
Blogging engine that generates a static blog

## Before using ##

Note that this code is in development and while I actually do intend to make it
production ready sooner rather than later, until I say it is, consider this
broken and probably not worth the time to setup. 

That being said, if you still want to set it up, I'd be thrilled to hear your
feedback on it.

## To use ##

Full instruction will come soon. But for now, install docker on your system. And
use the following command 

```
sudo docker pull spartakode/py341-flask-v1:latest
```

The process will be something like cloning the cms, and then using a run command
which I'll figure out later :D
